# QuickResize

A simple [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) extension to add new
commands to quickly resize the sprite.

On this fork of the extension, there's 2 menu options: one to resize to 96px, and another to upscale 300%.

Credit goes to David Capello for creating Aseprite and the original version of this extension.

## How to install it?

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Doodleboo/QuickResize-PIF/releases) and then:

1. On Windows and macOS, you can double-click the
   `QuickResize-PIF.aseprite-extension` file and the extension should be
   installed on Aseprite.
2. Other way is going to *Edit > Preferences > Extensions > Add
   Extension* and selecting the `QuickResize_PIF.aseprite-extension` file.
3. Restart Aseprite.
